# NLP_Sentiment_Analysis
We focus on one common text categorization task, sentiment analysis, the ex traction of sentiment, the positive or negative orientation that a writer expresses toward some object. A review of a movie, book, or product on the web expresses the authorâ€™s sentiment toward the product, while an editorial or political text expresses sentiment toward a candidate or political action. Automatically extracting consumer
sentiment is important for marketing of any sort of product, while measuring public sentiment is important for politics and also for market prediction. The simplest version of sentiment analysis is a binary classification task, and the words of the review provide excellent cues. Consider, for example, the following phrases extracted from positive and negative reviews of movies and restaurants,. Words like great, richly, awesome, and pathetic, and awful and ridiculously are very informative cues:

+ ...zany characters and richly applied satire, and some great plot twists 
- It was pathetic. The worst part about it was the boxing scenes... 
+ ...awesome caramel sauce and sweet toasty almonds. I love this place! 
- ...awful pizza and ridiculously overpriced...
